### S3 Storage

* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the internet.
* Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets.
* A bucket name must be DNS-compliant and follow below naming rules:
    * Be unique across all of Amazon S3.
    * Be between 3 and 63 characters long.
    * Not contain uppercase characters.
    * Start with a lowercase letter or number.
    * After you create the bucket, you can't change its name.
```
Note:
You are not charged for creating a bucket. You are charged only for storing objects in the
bucket and for transferring objects in and out of the bucket
